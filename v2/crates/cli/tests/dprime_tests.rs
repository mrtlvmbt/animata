//!   R15 — residual = 0 every tick on dprime_config (photo energy booked correctly to ledger.produced).

//!
//!   (a) Viability: N̄ ≥ VIAB_FLOOR at t=TICKS (both seeds).
//!       Anchor: N*_chem ≈ 134 (B3 corridor doc, same base chemistry as default_config). Light
//!       subsidy is additive → N* can only rise once photo_gain evolves. Floor = 0.60 × N*_B3 = 80
//!       (doc54 ±40% bracket; conservative since photo_gain starts at 0 and needs evolution time).
//!
//!   (b) Photo non-trivial: on a day-phase tick after TICKS evolution, photo_produced > PHOTO_DAY_FLOOR.
//!       Pre-declared floor: 1 eu/tick. In integer arithmetic, photo_demand(g, km=30, L=100) truncates
//!       to 0 for photo_gain=1 and ≥1 for photo_gain≥2. So floor=1 proves: gene escaped 0 (evolved
//!       to ≥2), path is wired, and contribution is non-zero. Seed variance under Ns≈0.1 drift is wide;
//!       1 eu/tick is the honest minimum. "Meaningful fraction" materialises at D′-2/D′-3 timescales.
//!
//!   (d) L(t) sim-level oscillation: photo_produced differs between a day tick and a night tick after
//!       evolution — night must be 0 (L=0 → no photo), day must exceed PHOTO_DAY_FLOOR.
//!       This is the sim-level complement to tooth (c): catches a wiring bug where L was computed
//!       correctly but the photo path wasn't actually gated on it.
